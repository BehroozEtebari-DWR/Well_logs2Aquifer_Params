For the following inputs, you will need to run the code separately for each input file. This means that for each individual input file, you should execute the code independently, ensuring that each file is processed one at a time. Make sure to modify the file path or input settings in the code before each run, depending on the specific file being used.

Let me know if you need help adjusting the code or if you would like more specific instructions for running the code for multiple files!
