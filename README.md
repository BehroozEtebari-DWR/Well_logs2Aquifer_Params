For the following inputs, you will need to run the code separately for each input file. This means that for each individual input file, you should execute the code independently, ensuring that each file is processed one at a time. Make sure to modify the file path or input settings in the code before each run, depending on the specific file being used.


# Pre-Processing Aquifer Parameters for C2VSimFG v2.0 (IWFM Engine) Model with 4 Layers Using ArcPy (IDW; No Pilot Points)

This repository includes tools for pre-processing aquifer parameters from scratch to model nodes for the C2VSimFG version 2.0 model (IWFM Engine) with 4 layers. The workflow utilizes ArcPy for interpolation (IDW) and does not rely on pilot points.

### Additional Jupyter Notebooks

Three Python Jupyter Notebooks (`10.0`, `10.1`, and `10.3`) have been developed to facilitate the conversion of pre-processed aquifer parameters, including the following:

- `Avg_CoarseFraction`
- `Avg_Kxy`
- `Avg_Kv`
- `Avg_Ss`
- `Avg_Sy`

These parameters are processed for all four layers of the C2VSimFG v2.0 model.

### Customizing for Other Model Configurations

For models with additional layers (e.g., 5, 6, 10, or 20), you may need to update the input IWFM model node file name and file path accordingly. Alternatively, you can convert GIS node shapefiles to CSV files as required.
